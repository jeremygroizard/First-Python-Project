EPAL WOOD PALLET CALCULATOR

OVERVIEW :
Welcome to the EPAL Wood Pallet Cost Calculator! This Python script is designed to help you estimate the production costs of an EPAL wood pallet made from maritime pine wood. The calculation takes into account the price of maritime pine wood, threaded nails, and other components required for pallet assembly.

HOW TO USE:
Run the script: Open the script in a Python environment and execute it.
Input prices: Enter the current market price of 1 m³ of maritime pine wood when prompted. Similarly, provide the prices for M5_5x90 threaded nails and M5_5x38 threaded nails, including all taxes.
View Results: The script will then calculate and display the total cost of the wood, along with the individual costs for the specified threaded nails.

FORMULA USED : 
The calculation is based on the volume of maritime pine wood required for one pallet (0.17 m³) and the respective prices of maritime pine wood, M5_5x90 threaded nails, and M5_5x38 threaded nails.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :
This script is a work in progress. Future updates may include additional features such as:
Electrical cost, staff cost...
